# LilBobbyTables-MyCRT 
## (MySQL Capture and Replay Tool)

### Background
Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been the face of cloud computing and has provided a plethora of related resources to consumers and businesses since 2002. These resources include Relational Database Services (RDS) which allows customers to host a MySQL database in the cloud. This database is fully managed by AWS, thus abstracting the customer from maintaining scalability, administration, and security. Customers who are looking to modify their MySQL RDS server environment want to preemptively test workloads before committing to these changes - a capability that is currently missing in RDS. The ability to compare workloads on different servers would enable customers to seamlessly test MySQT environment changes without affecting their production database. Our project, MyCRT, aims to provide this functionality.
